title: "Why you should try wearing both dresses and suits"
---

I'm glad you are here. I plan to talk about the expiration of gender norms and why you should try wearing clothing associated with the two binary genders regardless of your gender.
First of all, gender is just another social construct, like marrage and money. We chose to add value to it by supporting its existance for hundreads of years because it made life easier from a certain point of view. However, the time has come that we break away from constructs that hurt us more than they help us. The patriarchical ideology of binary genders hurts those identifying as women, but also men and non-binary individuls. 

Why am I telling you this? Because we need your help to change society. We need you, as a member of our sociaty, to make different choices that help more than they hurt us. 
How can you start? If you identify with one of the binary genders, try wearing clothing associated with the other gender for a day. Don't half-ass it! Really choose clothing you like and are comfortable in, and give it a solid go. See how you feel afterwards. Talk about it with your mates. Be kind to those who share their experiences with you.
